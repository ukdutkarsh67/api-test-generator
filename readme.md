Introduction
The "Auto-generation of API Test Cases using Playwright" project aims to streamline the API testing process by automating the generation of test scripts from existing Postman collections. This approach leverages Playwright, an advanced end-to-end testing framework, to execute the tests, ensuring comprehensive and efficient validation of APIs.

Project Overview
This project provides a solution for automatically converting Postman collections into executable Playwright test scripts. By doing so, it significantly reduces the manual effort involved in writing test cases and ensures consistency in API testing. The generated test scripts can be executed using Playwright, taking advantage of its robust testing capabilities to perform detailed validations.

Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd api-test-generator-playwright
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Usage
Ensure your Postman collection files (in JSON format) are placed in the collections directory.
Run the script to generate Playwright test cases:
bash
Copy code
node generateTestCases.js
Run the generated Playwright test cases:
bash
Copy code
npx playwright test

generateTestCases.js
This script is the core of the project, responsible for converting Postman collections into Playwright test scripts.

Key Functions:

Read Postman Collections: Reads JSON files from the collections directory.
Parse Collection Files: Extracts API request details, including name, method, URL, headers, and body.
Generate Test Scripts: Creates Playwright test scripts based on the extracted details.
Save Test Scripts: Writes the generated scripts to the tests directory with a .spec.js extension.
Learning and Benefits
Automation Benefits: Automating the conversion of Postman collections into test scripts saves time and reduces manual effort.
Playwright Proficiency: Understanding how to leverage Playwright for API testing, including making HTTP requests and performing assertions.
Project Structuring: Learning to structure a project to support automated testing and ES module syntax.
Error Handling: Handling errors effectively when reading files and parsing JSON data.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of automation in API testing by converting Postman collections into Playwright test scripts. It highlights the efficiency gains and error reduction that can be achieved through automation. By integrating Playwright, this project provides a robust framework for validating APIs, making it a valuable tool for developers and testers.
